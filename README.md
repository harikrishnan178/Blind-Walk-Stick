 # Blind-Walk-Stick Project

This project aims to create a simple and affordable electronic aid for visually impaired individuals. The Blind-Walk-Stick is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in the environment and provide feedback to the user through vibrations or sounds, allowing them to navigate safely.

# Features

Obstacle Detection: The ultrasonic sensor detects objects within a certain range and sends signals to alert the user.
Feedback System: The system can either produce vibrations or audible alerts when an obstacle is detected.
Low Power: Designed using a Raspberry Pi Pico, ensuring the device is power-efficient and portable.
# Components Used

Raspberry Pi Pico: Microcontroller for controlling the system.
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): For detecting obstacles in the path.
Buzzer/Vibration Motor: For providing feedback to the user.
Battery Pack: To power the system.
Connecting Wires: For circuit connections.
Stick/Frame: Physical structure to house the components.

# How It Works

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance between the user and any obstacles in front of them.
If an object is detected within a pre-set distance (e.g., 50 cm), the Raspberry Pi Pico triggers the buzzer or vibration motor.
This feedback alerts the user about the obstacle, allowing them to avoid it.
Software
The software is written in MicroPython and runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico. It processes data from the ultrasonic sensor and controls the buzzer/vibration motor based on obstacle detection.

# Future Enhancements

Multiple Sensors: Incorporate additional sensors for better obstacle detection coverage.
Advanced Feedback: Implement more nuanced feedback such as varying vibration intensity based on proximity to obstacles.
Battery Optimization: Further reduce power consumption for extended use.
